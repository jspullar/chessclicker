display quotes about chess

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_%28chess%29#History
In medieval chess, an attempt was made to make the pieces more interesting, each file's pawn being given the name of a commoner's occupation. On the board, from left to right, those titles were:
	Gambler and other "lowlifes", also messengers (in the left-most file, that direction being literally sinister)
	City guard or policeman (in front of a knight, as they trained city guards in real life)[3]
	Innkeeper (bishop)
	Merchant/Moneychanger (always before the king, whether or not he is to the left or right of the queen, which depends on the color of the pieces)
	Doctor (always the queen's pawn)
	Weaver/Clerk (in front of the bishop, for whom they wove or clericked)
	Blacksmith (in front of a knight, as they care for the horses)
	Worker/Farmer (in front of a castle, for which they worked)[4] - first achievement, "Start Farming!"
